            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>I knowe not how theſe things can be avoyded, nor how they can be anſwered, but this they ſay, that God willeth Iuſtice for it ſelfe, and ſinne not for ſinne, but that he might haue praiſe either in pardoning, or puniſhing the ſinne.</hi>

               <p>But to pardon or puniſh ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed, is not to will ſinne, but to will his owne praiſe. But if God willeth ſinn for any reſpect, why did and doth he puniſh <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſteritie, for the thing he willeth, yea decreeth vnauoydably? can that be in God, that he abhorreth, and that is contrary euen to nature?</p>
               <p>The Scriptures pronounceth that man bleſſed,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 15.2</note> that ſpeaketh the truth from his heart: And Chriſt ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 6.45</note> Out of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; what then if a man ſpeake one thing and meane an other thing, is he not iuſtly iudged an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite? and dare any earthen Pitcher attribute this to God, that in word he forbiddeth <hi>Adam</hi> and all men to ſinne, and in very deed willeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25466:8"/>
ſinne, &amp; hath ſo decreed it that it cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded. Is not this high blaſphemie to make God an hypocrite, who ſo hateth hypocrites?</p>
               <p>Now to proue that God decreed not, nor laid an neceſſity that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, God did not leaue him vnfurniſhed with any thing that might ſupport him in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, in which hee created him; as firſt, that God prouided him a moſt delectable place <hi>(Paradice.)</hi> ſecondly, that hee prouided all manner food ſufficient for his conſeruation, beſides the tree of knowledge, ſo that he was no way forced to eate of that tree: thirdly, he had a moſt fit helpe and comfort for him, his wife <hi>Heuah:</hi> fourthly, he had domination o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures: fiftly, God left him not idle, but appointed him worke, leaſt Satan ſhould thereby fill him with inuentions for want of imployment,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 13.24.</note> as he doth at ſuch times: ſixtly he gaue him a holy Lawe, the penaltie for the breach whereof was death: ſeauenthly, and laſtly, he gaue him will &amp; power not to haue eaten, as the contrary minded confeſſe: all which, manifeſtly proueth, againſt all gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, that God did neither decree, or laid any neceſſitie vpon <hi>Adam</hi> to tranſgreſſe, and ſo fall from that eſtate. If any obiect, that if God would not that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall, he would not haue giuen him a Lawe to enſnare him; I anſwer, that the giuing of the Lawe
<pb facs="tcp:25466:9"/>
was, that God might retaine his Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer man, and that man might teſtifie his dutifull ſubiection to his Lord and Creator, and alſo that God might be iuſt in puniſhing tranſgreſſion, and mercifull in forgiuing, through repentance and faith in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and therefore I conclude with th'Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. wherfore euery Law of God is holy, and the Commandement holy, and iuſt, &amp; good, and God doth no more intend to enſnare any man by any of his righteous Lawes, then a iuſt King, doth intend to enſnare any, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king iuſt Lawes againſt malefactors.

               <p>Two thinges I muſt heere manifeſt, 1. In what eſtate God made <hi>Adam,</hi> which I deſire may be well obſerued. 2. That many thinges bee done againſt the will of God. For the firſt I anſwer, it is an ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of theirs; for if God had made <hi>Adam</hi> that he could not but continue righteous, he muſt haue made him God like himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, or if God had made him that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25466:10"/>
could not but ſinne, what was he then but as the Deuils now are vnchangeable: But God in making Man, made a very good creature, yet ſubiect to change; by hauing his will brought to ſubmit vnto euill through the Deuils temptations: ſo that I may conclude that God could not make Man otherwiſe then he made him a reaſonable creature, yet mutable, able to obey his righteous precepts which if he did hee would continue him in that bleſſed eſtate bee created him in, if not, he would bring vpon him his iudgements: God not forcing him either way. Further if God had made <hi>Adam</hi> vnchangeably good that he could not breake his righteous Law, then it had bene to no purpoſe to ſet a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to that law, which could not bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed. And then had thoſe moſt holy attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, his Iuſtice to puniſh ſinne, and his Mercy to pardon vpon repentance, beene vtterly without vſe towards man; but if any obiect God making man changeable, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that God decreed he ſhould fall that he might make way for theſe his attributes. I anſwer, it is a falſe concluſion, for although God did know <hi>Adam</hi> would ſinne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided meanes of mercy for his ſinne, yet hee did not decree and force him to ſinne, for the cauſe aforeſaide, as alſo himſelfe teſtifieth.

God fore-ſeeth all thinges, yet doth he not will all thinges, for his foreſight doth extend both to good and euill, but his will is onely of thinges that be good, as God fore-ſeeth the death of a ſinner, and the cauſe thereof, namely his wickednes, but he willeth it not, as he ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 18.32. &amp; 33.11</note>, As I liue I will not the death of a ſinner, but that hee returne and liue. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did foreſee the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet he willed it not, for he wept, and bewailed it, Crying oh how would I haue gathered thy children, &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37.

and alſo foretell them, yet they may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, a few among many I will relate, and ſo conclude this. Wee may read 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>Dauid</hi> asked counſell of the Lord, If <hi>Saul</hi> would come downe to <hi>Keyla?</hi> and the Lord ſaid he will come downe. Then ſaid <hi>Dauid</hi> will the Lords of <hi>Keyla</hi> deliuer me into <hi>Sauls</hi> hands? and the Lord ſaide, they will deliuer thee. Then <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men departed from <hi>Keyla,</hi> which when <hi>Saul</hi> heard, hee came not to <hi>Keyla.</hi> Heere we plainely ſee that neither Gods foreknowledge, which is alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme to his ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither yet his Propheſie, did cauſe a neceſſity; for neither came <hi>Saul</hi> down to <hi>Keyla,</hi> neither did the men of <hi>Keyla</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Dauid</hi> into his hand.

So alſo of the wicked, hee knoweth and pronounceth they ſhall be damned, yet there lyeth no neceſſitie vpon their damnation, for it may be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by repentance, the which he ſaith as hee liueth he deſireth, as hath beene prooued.

               <p>Againe, as thinges be done againſt both Gods will, fore-knowledge, and foretelling; ſo alſo they bee done againſt Gods counſell.

proportion of Faith, and generality of the Scriptures, impute wickednes to the Deuill, which is proper to him; and good to the moſt holy God, as onely proper to him; now in that it is ſaid he moued, he ſuffered Sathan to moue, for God cannot moue to<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 1.13. Pſal. 5.4.</note> euill, of which more hereafter, before I end my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres to theſe particulers. Secondly, for that of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets, the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiah</hi> declares a viſion, in the which Sathan that lying Spirit came into the preſence of God, as <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. chap. offering himſelfe (if the Lord would permit him) to be a falſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the mouthes of <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Prophets, hee continually going about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom hee may deuout<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note>, and doth deuour where God reſtraineth him not; God willing to confound wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> (in Iuſtice) for his many wickedneſſes, ſaith not onely who ſhall entice <hi>Ahab,</hi> verſ. 20 but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thou ſhalt entice him, goe forth and doe ſo, verſ. 22. Now in theſe ſeuerall actions, we are to conſider that there was euils, namely Curſing, Enuy, Pride in numbring the people and deceipt, now the controuerſie is who was the firſt cauſe of this curſmg, enuy, pride, deceipt, not to ſpeake of the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were acted, for wee confeſſe God made <hi>Shemei, Dauid</hi> and all men<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17.18</note>, yea God made them that are now Deuils, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25466:17"/>
the life and being of men and Deuils, but in their Creation they were very good: now theſe hearts and mouthes of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures committed euill; the controuerſie I ſay now is, what the Lord doth in theſe actions. If you ſay Gods decree before the world, was the firſt cauſe, and that hee decreed vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably this curſing, enuy, pride and deceit, all which are either actions of the minde or body, then can it not bee denyed but God is the author of ſinne, his Decree being before there was either Deuill or man, and ſo is the firſt cauſe, and vpon Gods decree Sathan tempteth and Man conſenteth, and acteth as of neceſſitie they muſt; for they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde Gods decree; but this they ſticke not to affirme the chiefeſt of them as before hath bene ſhewed in <hi>Knox.</hi> So that Gods decree is the firſt cauſe, or author, of all that Sathan or wicked men effecteth; is not this good Doctrine? So then as men are iuſtly blamed for doing, and Sathan for tempting to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, enuy, pride and deceit, ſo ſhould God be moſt to be blamed (if this opinion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horrible blaſphemie were true) for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of neceſſitie by his Decree, Sathan to tempt, to it, and Man to conſent vnto and act it; Let none ſay that decreeing curſing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, pride and deceit, can be good in God, and wicked in the Deuill and man, for no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25466:18"/>
turning deuice can proue it, for although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that act wickednes may bee good (as they are from God) as Angels and men, yet the actions of thoſe inſtruments, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſinnes can not bee good from God, for he can tempt, decree, or appoint no man to euill, neither can euill dwell with him as before is proued.</p>
               <p>Next for that of <hi>Aſhur, Eſa.</hi> 10 5. &amp;c. a wicked nation ſent of God to puniſh a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſſembling Nation, which thing was good from God, namely to puniſh the wickednes of ſome, by others that are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, this is Gods Iuſtice, though the actors thereof thinke not ſo, hauing no reſpect to Gods iuſtice, but ſatisfieth their owne luſts. Now for the worde ſending; it is written in other places God ſhall ſend them ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to beleeue lyes;<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> dare any tongue ſay the deluſion comes from God, otherwiſe then by ſuffering the Deuill to delude them, who neede no ſending further then to haue leaue giuen him as of <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp;c. for he alwayes ſeeketh whom hee may deuour, ſo doe the wicked his children, it is their delight to hurt. So that in pride and malice, <hi>Aſhur</hi> went againſt the Iſralites, the Lord ſuffering him as a puniſhment for their ſinne (about whome he pitched his Tents whilſt they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that none could hurt them nor make

them afraide) as the Deuill in hatred to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde deludeth thoſe that reſiſt the truth, the Lord ſuffering him as a puniſhment for their ſinne; and thus God ſendeth and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as before is alſo proued. The Deuill deludeth<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4</note>, God ſuffereth<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note>. Now if the word (ſuffering) were vſed in all places in ſtead of ſending, they would not thus peruert the Scriptures, labouring to make wickednes come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods decree originally, for which cauſe let the holy Euangeliſts decide the controuerſie. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 8.31.32.</note> And the Deuils beſought IESVS ſaying.

All which proues plainely that the Deuill can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Gods ſuffering, as alſo that God or Chriſts ſending is nothing but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in this caſe.

If all that come from the Father of Lights be good, and this to moue (by decreeing vnauoidably) to theſe euill thoughts came from God, then was it good and not euill; but if their whole action was euill, as it was, then was it not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of this world,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.16.</note> though God brought out of it goodnes, who can bring good out of euill.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for that of our Sauiours death, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that God apointed him and gaue him to the Death for our ſinnes<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 5.25 &amp; 8.32.</note>, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him or ſuffered to bee deliuered into the hands of the wicked by his determinate cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and fore-knowledge<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.23. with Chap. 4.27.28.</note>, but I deny that God determined, appointed or decreed, that the wicked ſhould betray or murther him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by ſuffering them, hee knew what they would doe to him, and foretolde it long afore in the Scriptures, and decreed to ſuffer them, who if hee had pleaſed, hee might haue conſumed before they did it; but he decreed not that they ſhould ſo doe it;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25466:19"/>
for in doing thereof they were of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Deuill, who was the author of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the beginning, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. and not Gods decree. For might not God haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome to ſacrifice his Sonne CHRIST, as he did <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſraell</hi> their ſacrifices, which were types of him, which might haue beene done without wickednes? But hee could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray him, nor the Scribes and Phariſes to murther him, this was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, which God cannot appoint, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6.18</note>, hee cannot deſtroy the righteous with the wicked<note n="*" place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 18.25</note>, he cannot condemne the heyres of Promiſe<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note>, and ſo cannot appoint <hi>Iudas</hi> and the reſt to commit ſuch horrible wickednes as they did: euill cannot come from God, euery good giuing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from him, hee ſuffereth wicked men to doe thoſe thinges which hee cannot doe himſelfe, for which cauſe men think God to be like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 50.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>. Thus you may ſee that although God determined certainly that his Sonne ſhould be ſlaine, yet he might haue beene ſlaine without ſinne, and therefore the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying and murthering was not from God. Wee acknowledge that God is omnipotent, but wee ſay his omnipotencie is guided by his Iuſtice:<note place="margin">Omnipotency</note> he can doe onely the things that pleaſeth him, which is Iuſtice and Equitie.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25466:20"/>
It is no part of Gods Omnipotencie to lye, to deſtroy the righteous with the wicked, to appoint and by an vnauoydable decree force men to betray and Murther, &amp;c. theſe are not any part of Gods Omnipotencie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributing that to the moſt holy and iuſt God, which is proper to the Deuill. Gods holy will is the rule of his Power, and not his power the rule of his will: he will not lye, therefore I ſay he cannot lye. Thus haue I ſhewed how God is ſaid to doe a thing, when he onely ſuffereth it; wherein a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Caluin:</hi> agreeth with me vpon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. <hi>Lead vs not into Temptation:</hi> Vrſinus, <hi>pag.</hi> 1041. that the wicked execute the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God by ſinning, that commeth not to paſſe, by any fault of God himſelfe, but through the proper corruption of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſuch as themſelues haue purchaſed, God neither willing nor allowing nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor furthering their ſinne, but in his moſt iuſt iudgement onely permitting it, &amp;c. and <hi>Pag.</hi> 1042. The difference of the works of God and the Deuill, &amp;c. is euidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Story of <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 1. &amp; 2. where God purpoſeth to try <hi>Iob,</hi> but the Deuill to deſtroy him.

               <p>Hauing thus by the euidence of Scriptures proued, that man hath free choyſe, to chuſe, or refuſe, in matters of God, I will now ſpeak ſomthing to common experience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt remorſe of Conſcience in this life, and in Hell, doe ſufficiently proue this thing: for if men had not libertie, remorſe would not trouble any, for whatſoeuer euill we doe of neceſſity, preſently we excuſe it iuſtly, and acquite our Conſciences by impoſſibility; as if a man ſhould drinke poyſon not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he neuer would haue any ſcruple of conſcience, becauſe it was vnauoidable, hee could not preuent it; but if hee procured it himſelfe, or might haue preuented it, and would not, then the torture of conſcience will poſſeſſe him.</p>
               <p>Againe, that worme of Conſcience that ſticketh ſo deepe in the ſoules of all damned creatures, ſhould neuer appeare in hell, if men were depriued of libertie, for their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſteth in this, that for their owne demerits, being treated of God in ſuch ſort,

that if they would, Heauen laide open for them, by accepting Gods <hi>Grace</hi> through Faith and obedience to the Goſpell, and yet they caſt themſelues into Hell, of their owne accord, through vnbeliefe and rebellion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 No humane Law, can with iuſtice be enacted, but ſuch as may be obſerued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of euery iuſt Law is, to make good ſubjects, and therefore it were moſt abſurd, that all men were not able to keepe that Law; which was ordained for all, and by which all ſhall be iudged to be puniſhed that breake it.

               <p n="3">3 If men want free choyſe, what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall that be in the Scriptures ſo often repeated, that euery man ſhall receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes?

thing; For if they could not chuſe at that time they committed ſuch euills, but doe the ſame by the force of Gods <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> then what Law will puniſh a man with death for doing a thing vnauoydable, for it lay not in their power to auoyde; The Law of God neuer inflicted it vpon any, and the Law of the Princes of the earth doth not inflict it; For if a man kill another againſt his will; or when by no meanes he could auoyd it, death is not inflicted. But if he might haue auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it and did not, then had he libertie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde euill and did it not, and ſo iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth puniſhment.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25466:64"/>
but for their owne, when they haue a ſoule of reaſon and vnderſtanding; and a righteous law is giuen them, for ſinne is not imputed while there is no law: I haue alſo ſhewed that neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor any ſhall goe to hell for that ſinne, but for refuſing Chriſt: but this is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, that by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, all his poſterity haue weake<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8 3</note> natures, by the which, when the commandement comes<note n="*" place="margin">Cha. 7.10</note>, they cannot obey and liue, but ſinne, and ſo dye; till when, they are aliue without the law, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle<note n="*" place="margin">Verſe 9.</note>; and thus is verified, that all both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder ſinne;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> there is none righteous, no not one, there is none that ſeeketh God; they haue all gone out of the way, &amp;c.

               <p>But if any notwithſtanding what is ſaid, will not yet beleeue the truth in this, I require them, to ſhew by the Scriptures; better reaſons, then they haue yet obiected, to proue Infants to be in ſin, vnto condemnation in hell; and when they haue done that, let them alſo ſhew how they that haue ſinned, and are vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of hell, can be reconciled to God, but onely by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. And if they haue ſinned, and can be reconciled to God by no other meanes, but by repentance and faith in Chriſt Ieſus, then are they all left vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, not for any law that they haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for they could not breake the law before they were in forme and ſoule as before; but for their Father <hi>Adams</hi> eating of the forbidden tree, and ſo are damned for their Fathers ſinne, contrary to all theſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Let not any thinke, that this maketh any thing for them, that becauſe Infants haue died many times, bodily death for the ſins of their parents, as the old world, <hi>Sodome</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah, Corah,</hi> &amp;c. that therefore they periſh with the wicked in hell, for of this, other vnreaſonable creatures, as well as Infants, haue alwaies had

their portions: all fleſh muſt dye, and death is loſſe to none but to the wicked; for whom is prepared the torments of hell, but vnto the godly, and innocent, death, and all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life, are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>If any aske, that if Infants be not vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, what neede they haue of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> I anſwere; vnſpeakeable benefits they haue by him; for beſides through his redemption they liue, &amp; moue, and haue their being, &amp; enioy ll other earthly bleſſings; they haue by Chriſt, their reſurrection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, for as in <hi>Adam</hi> they die, ſo in Chriſt they ſhall be made aliue:<note place="margin">1.

               <p>This place indeed is much alledged for infants Baptiſme; but what truth there is in it, will eaſily appeare.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25466:75"/>
them ſtill as your Wiues, to all thoſe vſes whereto they are appointed, This appeares in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14 in theſe wordes, Elſe were your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vncleane, but now they are holy, as if hee ſhould ſay: If your vnbeleeuing Wiues were not holy, then your children were not holy, but you make no queſtion of your children, and therfore your wiues are holy much more, for ſo theſe words ſhew, <hi>Elſe</hi> were your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vncleane, but now are they holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holineſſe</hi> in Scripture is taken two wayes, 1. Either when a perſon or thing is ſanctified, or ſet apart from the Common or prophane vſe, vnto the ſeruice of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 35.2 &amp; 16.23.</note> as was the Saboth day ſanctified to the Lord: &amp; as was <hi>Iſraell</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Leuit. 20 26. &amp; Exod 13.2.</note>. or 2. When a perſon or thing is ſet apart or ſanctified to the beleeuer<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.5 Tit. 1.15.</note>. <hi>Thus</hi> is the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Wife holy, and thus are the Children holy, and not otherwiſe, There is now no ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to God, of a perſon, but ſuch as whoſe harts are purified by Faith in CHRIST IESVS<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15.9. 1.

                     </gap>. &amp;c.</note>. Now the Apoſtle ſaith, The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man is holy, and the vnbeleeuing wife is holy, or ſanctified; now the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Children are holy as the beleeuer, or as the vnbeleuer? If as the beleeuer, (as they ſay) then are they ſeperated from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vſes, in which they were vſed, and are ſet now apart to Gods vſe: and can teſtifie that their hearts are purified by Faith. But if their holines be as the vnbeleeuers, (as we ſay) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they clean
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25466:76"/>
to the vſe of the beleeuer, as his vnbeleeuing Wife is, not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Further, th'Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>Elſe</hi> were your Infants vncleane, &amp;c. but elſe were your Children vncleane, but now they are holy; ſo that all the Children of beleeuers, though of age, and vnbeleeuers, are as holy by this place as Infants, and then we would know how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Children, can be holy, if not as the vnbeleeuing Wife is holy, that is to the vſe of their Parents in the duties of relation; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, If their argument be good, they that are holy muſt be Baptiſed, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers whether Wiues or Children (aſwell as Infants) muſt be Baptiſed, for the Apoſtle affirmeth they are holy.</p>

               <p>This place is exceedingly miſconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, being brought to proue Infants baptiſme, I will take a little paines therfore to open and explaine the place. In the calling of this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, all may ſee the drift and meaning of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25466:77"/>
holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> not that <hi>Moſes</hi> did at all waſh them with water in the Cloude and Sea; but th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writing to the Saincts at <hi>Corinth,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them among other things, to take heed of Preſumption, they thinking themſelues ſure and ſafe becauſe they had put on CHRIST by Baptiſme, and were Chriſtians: and firſt hee ſheweth them a ſimilie of two runners, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to them; ſaying, ſo runne that ye may obtaine: And further vrgeth it by himſelfe, ſaying, I beate downe my body, and bring it in ſubjection, leaſt when I haue Preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, my ſelfe ſhould become a caſt away: After hee hath done with the ſimilie he paſſeth to an example, as if he ſhould ſay, beſides this I would haue you vnderſtand, how <hi>God</hi> delt with our Fathers when hee brought them out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> with ſignes and wonders, and gaue them manifeſt tokens of his loue, in giuing them a Cloude to couer and defend them by Day and night, and cauſed the Sea, to deuide it ſelfe for them to paſſe ouer, and fed them 40 yeares with Bread from Heauen, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hard Rockes to yeeld them drinke, by the which teſtimonies of his fauour he offered them <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and did confirme vnto them by theſe extraordinary wonders, that he was their <hi>God;</hi> yet for all this, when they ſinned, he was diſpleaſed with them, and deſtroyed them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times: euen ſo you <hi>Corinthians,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you are Chriſtians, and haue Chriſts
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25466:78"/>
ordinances among you, the pledges of Gods fauour, as theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had in their time, yet if you ſinne (without repentance) you ſhall periſh as they did, for their example is written for our learning. And thus, this of <hi>Moſes</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Baptiſme by compariſon, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke is called the figure of the Baptiſme that ſaueth: For as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke ſaued them that were in it, from drowning in the water, yet afterwards ſome of them periſhed; ſo our Fathers were all vnder the cloude and in the Sea, and were all therein Baptiſed or ſafe guarded from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their enemies, yet afterwards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them periſhed: Euen ſo true Baptiſme, ſaueth them that are in it, or put on Chriſt by it, from the deſtruction of Hell, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards many may periſh that hold not faſt that profeſſion vnto the end; and hereupon th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle concludeth; Let him that thinketh hee ſtandeth, take heed leaſt he fall. And this is the meaning of this Scripture, &amp; cannot with any ſhew of truth be produced for Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: If any further aske why it is ſaid they were Baptiſed in the Sea and cloude; I anſwer, it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt ſo to ſpeake, for the reaſons which I haue ſhewed: the Cloude and Sea was their ſafety, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was, and as true Baptiſme is; and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, They are Baptiſed that ſuffer for his ſake: So there is aſmuch warrant to enioyne Infants to ſuffer perſecution, becauſe it is called by the name of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25466:78"/>
                  <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as to Baptiſe them, from this place becauſe the cloude and Sea is called <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>

               <p>Againſt which, <hi>Iohn Rob.</hi> layeth downe as a foundation of his proofes 2 ſpeciall rules: <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </gap> there is no lawfull Baptiſme, but by him that hath a lawfull calling to Baptiſe, his warrant he ſeemes to haue<note n="*" place="margin">1 Theſ. 11. Heb. 5.4.</note>. 2. His ſecond rule is; that onely he hath an ordinary lawfull calling to Baptiſe, who is called thereto by the Church, to which hee ſets no Scripture.</p>
               <p>His inference is: That all thoſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wee, not being Baptiſed by any ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but by thoſe they conceiue conuerted them, by their gift, are vnlawfully Baptiſed, and ſo vnbaptiſed perſons.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer both theſe, the firſt needs litle; for we affirme with him, that there is no lawfull baptiſme, but by him that hath a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling to Baptiſe, &amp;c. From whence mark what followeth againſt himſelfe: that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Baptiſme, that is adminſtred by him that is not lawfully called to Baptiſe: But <hi>Io. Rob.</hi> was baptiſed by one not lawfully called thereto as himſelfe confeſſetth<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Juſtific. ſc per.</hi> pa. 285 &amp;c.</note> Therfore that baptiſme hee retaines and pleades for, by his owne ground is vnlawfull Baptiſme. <hi>Thus</hi> in ſmiting vs he woundeth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To the 2. Rule he hath annexed 6. proofes: but firſt to anſwer the rule, &amp; after the proofes in particuler. The rule together with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is alſo fully againſt himſelfe; for if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee that hath an ordinary lawfull calling
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25466:90"/>
from a Church muſt Baptiſe, and they that are baptiſed by any not ſo called are vnbaptiſed perſons, then himſelfe and his followers being Baptiſed by thoſe that both wanted a true Church to call them, and alſo an ordinary law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling to baptiſe, as himſelfe confeſſeth, is both vnlawfully baptiſed, and ſo vnbaptiſed perſons by his owne ground; thus is the wiſe catched in his owne craftines.</p>
               <p>Againe in all his 6 proofes, there is not one Scripture confirmes his rule; his rule is: <hi>That onely hee hath an ordinary lawfull calling to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, who is called thereto by the Church,</hi> but none of thoſe produced by him, were called thereto by any Church to baptiſe, therefore ſerues not his purpoſe. Beſides, <hi>they were none of them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of any particuler Flocke,</hi> which is the thing hee muſt proue or nothing. And for vs who he intends his rule &amp; inference againſt wee haue and ſhall through the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew to euery reaſonable man, either his groſſe ignorance, or his willing ſubtilty, &amp; our owne innocency that wee all are both lawfully Baptiſed &amp; baptiſed perſons according to the will of <hi>God.</hi> And for an extraordinary calling wee challenge none, but content our ſelues with what the <hi>Word</hi> affoords vnto vs, and that which it warrants not, is extraordinary; which is doctrines of <hi>Io.

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:25466:90"/>Theſe 2. rules he calls his Foundation. And for his proofes: He firſt laboreth to make <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Chriſts</hi> Diſciples, <hi>Phillip, Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> example extraordinary, &amp; therefore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not now for any mans practiſe; the which I haue formerly anſwered: vnto which I will a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, that if theſe ſeruauts of <hi>Gods</hi> example in Baptiſing, be not written for our inſtruction, no more is their example for teaching; but the latter hee granteth to bee written for inſtruction; for hee confeſſeth a man may Preach and conuert, though not in office, and therfore the latter, the holy Scriptures conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>In that Chriſt hath coupled them together</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 28.1</note>. But here I will aske him one queſtion. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtles were extraordinary men; Therefore there practiſes are no directions to vs, being not in office of Paſtor, &amp;c. By what authority he Baptiſeth his companies Infants? and who gaue him that authority? He will tell me, hee baptiſeth by vertue of his Paſtorſhip; but ſtill I ask him who ordayned him into that Office? His company, not being Officers, where is his warrant for that? I am ſure he can ſhew none in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Teſtament: If hee bring <hi>Act.</hi> 6. or <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. or <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>or the like.</hi> I will anſwer him, theſe that, ordained were <hi>Apoſtles, Euangeliſts:</hi> If he ſay, theſe are written for the inſtruction of Diſciples not in Office; ſo I ſay is <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> Therefore let him either confeſſe, that he Apoſtles practiſe are written for the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:25466:91"/>
example of Diſciples not in Office, to Baptiſe aſwell as to ordayne; or elſe let him caſt off his <hi>Paſtorſhip</hi> receiued of his company not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Office, and take vnto him againe his olde <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſthood, receiued by ordination through <hi>Rome,</hi> aſwell as his <hi>Popiſh</hi> Baptiſme; otherwiſe the Godly wiſe, will iudge him a blinde wilfull man.</p>
               <p>His 2. proofe is little materiall, it was <hi>The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that Chriſt calleth the fulfilling of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,</hi> which is ſtill the ſame, when any Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is baptiſed by a Diſciple, who (as hath beene ſhewed) is called thereunto: and <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning was not, that <hi>hee had need to bee baptiſed with water,</hi> but with that other <hi>baptiſme</hi> the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> and Fire, which <hi>hee had formerly declared to the people Chriſt ſhould Baptiſe with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 3. proofe makes againſt himſelfe, for though the ignorant and blind <hi>Phariſes,</hi> asked <hi>Iohn, why he Baptiſed,</hi> as <hi>Io.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:25466:92"/>
there was firſt one ſtood vp and made a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and then another, and theſe two ioyned together, and ſo a third, and theſe became a Church ſay they, which we denie, except a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan; for was euer Church of the new Teſtament made by a couenant without baptiſme? there is not the leaſt ſhowe for it.
